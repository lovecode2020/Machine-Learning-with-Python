**Line Plot**:

1. **Representation of Data**:
   - Line plots represent data points as individual markers connected by straight lines. They are used to show the trend or pattern of a single variable over time or across a range of values.

2. **Number of Variables**:
   - Line plots are typically used for one variable (univariate). They can also be used to compare the trends of multiple variables on the same plot.

3. **Emphasis on Trends**:
   - Line plots are effective for emphasizing trends, patterns, and fluctuations in the data. They provide a clear view of how the variable changes over time or across values.

4. **Specific Data Points**:
   - Each data point is clearly marked on the plot, making it easy to see the specific values associated with each point.

5. **Continuous Axis**:
   - Line plots work well with a continuous axis (e.g., time, numerical values) on the x-axis.

**Area Plot**:

1. **Representation of Data**:
   - Area plots represent data using a filled area under a line. They are used to show the cumulative contributions or totals of different categories over time or across a range of values.

2. **Number of Categories**:
   - Area plots are typically used for multiple categories (multivariate). They emphasize the relative proportions or percentages of different components.

3. **Emphasis on Composition**:
   - Area plots focus on the composition of the total. They show how each category contributes to the overall total, making them effective for part-to-whole relationships.

4. **Percentage Contribution**:
   - Area plots are particularly useful for highlighting the percentage contribution of each category to the total.

5. **Time or Continuous Axis**:
   - Area plots work well with a time or continuous axis on the x-axis, allowing for the representation of data over a range of values.

**Choosing Between Line and Area Plots**:

- Use a **line plot** when you want to emphasize the trend or pattern of a single variable over time or across a range of values. Line plots are excellent for showing the continuous changes in a variable.

- Use an **area plot** when you want to focus on the composition or cumulative contributions of different categories to a total. Area plots are effective for visualizing part-to-whole relationships.

Both types of plots have their strengths, and the choice between them depends on the nature of your data and the message you want to convey.
